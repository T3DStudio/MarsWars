General:
- edited some points in pdf help and in-game text (thanks to Õðþê Çëþêåì);
- removed the "Builders at game start" setting; the number of builders at game start now depends on the value of the "generators" setting: on the "own" setting, players get one regular builder, and on the "neutral(...)" assignments - 2 improved;
- added restriction on the maximum number of builders per player - no more than 4 (you can't get more, including using "Phantom" unit to capture enemy "Command Center");
- removed the ban on building new "Command Center"/"Hell Keep" in the "neutral" generators mode;
- removed the restriction on the number of special buildings (buildings that unlock technology and buildings-superweapons);
-- changed the mechanics of super weapons: "Altar of Pain"/"Rocket Launcher Station" now take 10 limit, cost more energy, take 2 minutes to build and do not require special "upgrade charges" for themselves; recharge after use is equal to the build time;
-- "upgrade-charges" for superweapons are removed;
- the duration of invulnerability from the "Altar of Pain" ability no longer depends on the limit the target occupies and lasts for 30 seconds for everyone;
- production buildings can now be upgraded 3 times (each next level allows you to produce more units/upgrades at the same time);
- generators have two more improvement levels;
- new sprites for each level of production buildings and generators;
- new sprites for UAC transports;
- added building animation sprites for Totem of Horror, Monastery of Despair, Castle of Damned, Evil Eye and Altar of Pain;
- since there is currently no pathfinding for units in the game: the map generator can no longer create a map with islands or complex labyrinths (there will always be a passage between obstacles);
- The "lakes" item has been removed from the map generator settings; lakes now always make up half of large map obstacles;
- removed the ability (and the upgrade that opens it) to build some buildings on map obstacles;
- removed the ability (and the upgrade that opens it) for some ground units to move on the map decorations;
- implemented translucent fog of war;
- corrected the mechanics of the "special ability at a point" order: now the order is given to the closest unit to the specified point that is able to execute this order;
- changed the approach to loading music: previously the game loaded all tracks from the directory, which led to a very long launch; now the playlist is selected and loaded no more than a certain number of random tracks; in the sound options section added an item that allows you to specify the number of tracks in the playlist that will be loaded; also added a button that allows you to load a new playlist during the game; the same track played during the game is no longer looped (unless it is not the only one in the playlist);
- if there is at least one unit with a special ability among the selected units (and able to execute it at the moment) - its ability icon will be displayed on the orders tab;
-- similarly with units that can be improved or rebuilt in other units: the icon of the new unit will be displayed;
- selecting units and assigning them to control groups on digits is now a client-side operation (in all previous versions it was server-side, because of what client players had a lag between the action in the interface and the reaction to this action in the game);
- added option to stretch the menu (previously it always remained 800*600, regardless of the window resolution);
-- there is also a separate option to smooth the stretched menu;
- added "surrender" option;
- you can use domain addresses when connecting to the server;
- a number of bug fixes, as well as minor tweaks to AI bots;

Most important balance changes:
- changes in time/energy cost for all units: now, on average, they require more energy and less time to build(now units are generally built faster than before);
- Veteran system: removed the progression of time required to level up to the next level (previously it was 30-60-90 seconds, now it is 30 seconds for each level);
- base damage for all units decreased from 62 to 52; multipliers increased: where it was *1.5 - became *2, for siege units: it was *3, became *4 (for "Cyberdemon" remained *3, but removed *0. 5 multiplier on light units); base bonus from upgrades was reduced from 8 to 7; bonuses from veteranism remained the same; on average, in situations where the damage multiplier is not applied - units take longer to kill each other, and faster - where the multiplier is applied;
- "Arch Vile" is now able to resurrect other player`s monsters (making them your own); ability cooldown removed;
- zombie infantry attributes have been changed to complement the basic composition of the demon army;
-- "Former Zombie" changed to "Zombie Medic" which can heal; healing is similar to UAC Medic, but only Hell units can be targeted;
- all units that take less than 2 limits have reduced sight/shooting radiuses; slightly reduced the size of these units;
-- "Siege Marine"/"Siege Zombie" no longer deal area damage next to the target;
- "BFG Marine"/"Zombie BFG Marine" now takes 5 limits and has a 0.5 multiplier on buildings; old damage multiplier where damage depended on the limit the target occupied has been removed;
- removed the "slow" turn towards the movement point for UAC transports;
- increased Command Center flight speed;
- some units now have an additional radius of attack on certain categories of units (for example - almost all siege units shoot farther at buildings);
- "Cyberdemon": now takes 10 limit instead of 12, health, damage and cost have been proportionally reduced;
- Health of the main Hell buildings (all except generators, static defense and "Evil Eye") increased by 2500; the same buildings now have initial health regeneration;
- "Advanced Command Center"/"Great Hell Keep" now give more energy (increased by 300);
- "Guard Tower" renamed to "Imp`s Tower"; "Imp`s Tower" can no longer attack other "Imp`s Towers"; "Imp" can no longer attack "Imp`s Towers" with long-range attacks;
- "Imp`s Tower" can now be rebuilt into "Totem Of Horror" and "Totem Of Horror" back into "Imp`s Tower"; you cannot get "Totem Of Horror" without building "Imp`s Tower";
- "UAC Fighter": removed missile attack on air units; removed upgrade that allows "laser" attack on ground targets - now this unit can attack both ground and air units with "laser" attack at once; multiplier *2 on ground light units/buildings;
- "UAC Terminator": added upgrade that allows attacking air units; air attack is less effective than Antiaircrafter;
- "Anti-ground/air Turret" now has a "special ability" to deconstruct this turret in "UAC Drone"; "Drone Transformation Protocol" upgrade required;
- increased health of generators, towers (stat. defense) and super weapon buildings;

- double F2-hotkey now moves camera to nearest combat unit;
-- "smart F2": F2 hotkey selects all combat units, except those that:
--- patroling;
--- holding position;
--- performing  "special ability at point" order;
--- going to Teleport;
--- going to transport or going to pickup on board a unit;

-- exceptional behavior for Pain Elemental: this unit will start spawning Lost Souls/Phantoms to target point;
- changed buttom positions and hotkeys for unit`s basic orders on the "Controls" tab;
- "space" hotkey now moves camera to last event location;
- only basic orders (move, attack, destroy) are transferred to all units in the selected group; other orders are transferred to the first unit in the group that can execute them;
- unit's abilities(like Radar`s scan) now casts by "special ability at point" order;
- no automatic production cancellation when energy drops below 0;
- players can now set attention markers is multiplayer game;

Units and balance:
- COMMON:
-- units leave the barracks in the direction where the rally point was placed;
-- the maximum limit of units per player is increased to 125;
-- some units and buildings can now consume more than 1 limit;
-- production buildings can now be advanced; an advanced version can create/research two units/upgrades at the same time; a special technology building is required for advancement;
- main buildings and generators can also be advanced - an advanced version of a building gives x2 energy, but other characteristics do not change; advancing these buildings does not require any technology;
-- rebuilding/advacement time is increased if the original building/unit has been damaged; the rebuilding/advancing process CANNOT be undone;
-- detection of invisible units no longer requires any upgrade;
-- the "soaring" unit type has been removed from the game - now units are strictly either ground or air;
--- some ground units, under certain conditions, can move above the map doodads and have the attribute "floating";
-- change unit categories -- each unit necessarily has one of the following 4 pairs of attributes: unit/building, biological/mechanical, light/heavy, ground/air;
-- the system of "advancing" units has been completely redesigned - some abilities have been moved to upgrades (for example, invisibility for demon and commando), or separated into different units (Shotgunner and Super Shotgunner, Hell Knight and Baron of Hell - now different units);
-- implemented veteran system: initially all units are level 1, in battle they can advance up to 4; each level gives a small bonus to attack, defense and reduces the frequency of pain state (if a unit has one);
--- units "advancing" twice as fast in close combat;
-- hits, energy cost, damage of units multiplied by 10/100 times for more "fine-tuning"; on average, units are now more expensive and take longer to kill each other;
-- "Pain State" time increased to 1 second;
-- totally new unit balance system;


-- most units in the game have only one damage modifier;
-- buildings now have no armor initially, but a defense upgrade gives twice as much as an attack bonus upgrade to units; thus, buildings can be destroyed by anyone in the early game, and the value of siege units increases later in the game;

-- basic attack/defense upgrades now have 5 levels;
-- upgrades may now have a time and/or energy cost that progresses with each level;
-- each side added an upgrade to increase sight and firing range for all combat units;
-- the projectile mechanics have been modified to minimize the chance of missing the target:
--- projectile velocity has been increased;
--- projectiles are now "magnetized" to their target;
--- revenants now have homing projectilles initially;
-- all buildings in the game, except builders, detectors and static defense have greatly reduced sight radius;
-- unit life time as a corpse has been increased to 28 seconds;


- UAC

-- BUILDINGS:
--- Command Center - reduced flight speed; can be upgraded to Advanced Command Center, which gives x2 energy, all other things being equal; Advanced Command Center is needed to research some upgrades;
--- Barrack - formerly Military Unit - now a classic barrack, producing only infantry (biological) units;
--- Factory - a new production building for vehicles;
--- Weapon Factory - unchanged, as before - the only upgrade production building; also opens up access to some T1 units;
---- all 3 production buildings can be advanced once; advanced version has different sprites and can produce 2 units/upgrades at a time; energy advance costs the same as building a new building, but is 1/4 faster in time and requires a Computer Station;
--- Generator - now takes 2 limits; can be rebuilt into an advanced version, giving x2 energy, other things being equal;
--- Static defense: two turrets with narrow specialization - against ground and air units; anti-ground initially shoots as Commando (effective against light+biological), but after special upgrade gets Plasmagun as second weapon against mechanical units; turrets can be rebuilt into each other for the same energy cost and in quarter less time;
--- Science Center - now just a "tech" building - gives access to T2 units and upgrades for them; building sprites changed;
--- Computer Station - new, another "tech" building; gives access to T2 buildings and upgrades for them; allows you to advance production buildings;
---- both technological buildings can be only 1 instance;
--- Radar - now takes 2 units limit; ability time is now fixed at 8 seconds, and special upgrade only increases vision and scanning radiuses; you can now build as many radars as you want; ability recharge time increased to 1 minute; a flashing sprite now appears above units that are being radar-scanned;
--- Rocket Launcher Station - number of missile strikes reduced to 2; requires both technological buildings for itself; during volley reveals itself in a fog of war for all players for a couple of seconds and a minute to reload;

-- UNITS:
These are just the major changes, for more information on each unit - see the PDF document or in-game hints;
--- mines removed from the game;
--- APC removed from the game;
--- multiple medics/engineers can no longer heal/repair the same target;
---- but can now heal/repair while the target is taking damage;
--- Medics and Engineers no longer have a paralyzing attack;
--- new infantry type added - antiaircrafter, specialized ground antiaircraft;
--- half of infantry now has the attribute [heavy];
--- Plasmagainer is now initially flying and it will not be possible to lower it to the ground; now it attacks both flying and ground targets;
--- added a new mechanical anti-mech - UAC Dron - attacks similarly to the plasmagainer, but only on the ground; has two unique, researched abilities: one gives the ability to move around the map doodads, the second allows it to rebuild itself into an anti-ground turret;
--- BFG-Marine now has a unique damage modifier: the damage is multiplied by the used limit of the unit;

- HELL
-- BUILDINGS:
--- Building names have been changed (the word Hell is now repeated much less frequently): Hell Gate -> Demon`s Gate; Hell pools -> Infernal Pools; Hell Monastery -> Monastery of Despair; Hell Altar -> Altar of Pain; Hell Eye -> Evil Eye;
--- Hell Keep - as well as a similar building in UAC, can be upgraded to an advanced version(Great Hell Keep);
---- Pain Aura now burns weaker, but the damage ignores units' armor;
--- Demon`s Gate and Infernal Pools - changes similar to Barrack/Weapon Factory;
--- Pentagram of Death - unlike UAC, Hell has 3 tech buildings; this building allows you to build Cyberdemons and Masterminds;
--- Monastery of Despair and Castle of Damned - are technological buildings, similar in function to those of UAC;
--- as well as UAC - technological buildings can be only 1 instance;
--- Teleport - the maximum count unlimited now, but now takes 4 units limit. The teleportation destination now requires a beacon unit (any own or allied unit), but there must be no obstacles under the "beacon" (if the beacon is a flying unit over a lake/rock, no teleportation is possible); only OWN ground units can use the teleport; recharge time after teleportation is calculated as X*Unit limit seconds, X originally=6, but it can be reduced with a special upgrade: 1 level of upgrade = -1 second. Earlier, to reverse teleportation it was necessary to select a unit, move the screen to the teleport and do Mouse Right Click on it - now there is an alternative, more convenient way: you can select the teleport and execute a "Special ability at point" order on the desired unit;
--- Altar of Pain - now requires all 3 technological buildings; you can accumulate 2 spheres of invulnerability, but after casting there is a cooldown of 1 minute;
---- invulnerability time now depends on unit's limit, formula is simple: 64sec - (limit*4sec);
--- Evil Eye is now built as a normal building; is originally a detector; at health greater than 1/4 has permanent invisibility, including during construction (visible only the first 7 seconds after construction began); it can be created not only around Hell Keep, but also around other Evil Eye, thus stretching exploration of the map; has a special upgrade, which increases the radius of view; has the ability: can give any his or allied unit to be a detector for 8 seconds, itself, in this case, dies;

-- UNITS
--- Lost Soul can no longer be built as a separate unit in Demon`s Gate (but can be built in a cursed UAC barracks); is now originally an air unit, but when attacking ground enemies it temporarily becomes a ground unit; no longer has the ability to turn into Evil Eye; there is a limit on the maximum number per player - 20;
--- new unit: Phantom (Lost Soul from the alpha version of DOOM, Pain Elemental begins to produce it after a special upgrade; also Phantom can be built in the zombie barracks) can curse barracks and CC UAC, as well as raise to take over the corpses of infantry raising them as zombies; a cursed CC is also a builder (with a limited set of buildings and a cursed barracks instead of Demon`s Gate) and is originally able to fly and attack; aside from the ability to zombify corpses of infantry and curse buildings, as well as the greater cost in time and energy, Phantom is no different from Lost Soul, so it makes no sense to upgrade to it in Hell vs Hell; there is a limit on the maximum number per player - 20;
--- Demon - increased movement and attack speed; added a unique upgrade that allows the demon to run across the map decorations; movement speed on decorations is halved;
--- Cyberdemon, Mastermind and Arachnotron are now mechs;
--- Cyberdemon and Mastermind are no longer limited (but now they take up a lot of limit);
--- Arachnotron is now an anti-mech;
--- Revenant is now anti-air;
--- Arch-Vile: unit resurrection ability investigated by separate upgrade and has a 3 second cooldown; can now resurrect allied monsters; resurrected monster has 1/2 health; has the game's largest single damage - 8 "standard DPS" every 2 seconds;

Known bugs:
- while watching a replay (and less often - in multiplayer game) sometimes you can see projectiles flying across the map from shooting visible units - a visual defect of the architecture of the client part of the game;
- in multiplayer game, if you set "units update rate" to the maximum value, some units can stop updating (units will just stand still and do not change their state); cured by reducing the value of this setting; most likely, the game generates very large packets that can not pass through the network, in future versions I will try to study this problem;
